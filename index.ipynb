    "# Introduction to GraphBLAS with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The GraphBLAS is an API for [sparse matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix) and vector operations to solve graph problems using [Linear Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra).  pygraphblas wraps the GraphBLAS API using [CFFI](https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  This notebook is an introduction to the GraphBLAS and also tutorial on how work with graphs in Python using the pygraphblas library.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an mathematical introduction see [Mathematical Foundations of the GraphBLAS](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~aydin/GraphBLAS-Math.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several examples of common algorithms implemented with pygraphblas [NOT AVAILABLE IN BINDER]:\n",
    "\n",
    " - [PageRank](./PageRank.ipynb)\n",
    " - [Betweeness Centrality](./BetweenessCentrality.ipynb)\n",
    " - [K-Truss Subgraphs](./K-Truss.ipynb)\n",
    " - [Triangle Counting](./Triangle-Counting.ipynb)\n",
    " - [RadiX-Net Topologies](./RadiX-Net-with-pygraphblas.ipynb)\n",
    " - [User Defined Types](./User-Defined-Types.ipynb)\n",
    " - [Log Semiring](./Log-Semiring.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "The follow is a brief introduction to some of pygraphblas' features.  Over time the goal will be to improve the documentation and examples.  For any suggestions, please [open an issue](https://github.com/michelp/pygraphblas/issues) so we can discuss it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Matrices can represent Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "The key concept of the GraphBLAS is that [a matrix can represent a graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix) and [Linear Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra) can be used to operate on graph matrices.  In the conventional sense, a graph is a set of nodes that have edges connecting them.  The same connectivity can be represented as a matrix where edges are weight value at the intersection of rows and columns.  The rows represent the outgoing node, and the column represents the incoming node.\n",
    "\n",
    "By relying on the mathmatical foundations of graph theory and abstract algebra, graph problems can be expressed in a closed, composible algebraic language. Instead of thinking of problems node and edge at a time, GraphBLAS encourages you to think of and operate on the graph as a whole object using well understood mathmatical techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "For expedience we'll import the entire pygraphblas library into this notebook with `import *`.  This is normally not a recommended practice.  This won't effect the examples here but keep it in mind."
